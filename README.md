# My Website
A little place where I host real cool stuff, and dissapoint my web teacher by not including a nav menu.

## Contribution
The docs folder is where Jekyll outputs the website build and is what is hosted by github pages. Any changes there will be overwritten. Instead, please contribute changes to the source.
