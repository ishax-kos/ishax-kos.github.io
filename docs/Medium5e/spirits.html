    <h1>On Spirits</h1>
<h3>What is a Spirit?</h3>
<p>A spirit... [insert explanations here...] It includes elementals, fiends, celestials, ghosts, phantoms and wraiths, as well as other intangible beings not listed anywhere, such as the myriad of nature spirits throughout the world.
</p>
<h3>How do I get Spirits to Follow Me?</h3>
<p>You learn to appease spirits and barter with supernatural forces. In order to use the channeling ability, you must first gain the aid of a spirit. To gain the service of a spirit, you must first gain audience with it.
</p>
<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>    Finding a spirit is no simple task. Though many spirits reside on the mortal realm, you can’t expect to find them behind every tree and rock (The spirit of your average tree won’t be of much use anyway). Often you will require elaborate and expensive rites to contact beings from other planes, but sometimes a Medium need only ask around.
</p>
<p>To summon faraway Spirits, you must perform an elaborate ritual. For a spirit of nature, or a soul that is yet to pass, the summons must be Performed from a place relevant to its nature. This can be where it had passed away or somewhere close to its remains or the place it still haunts (if it is a soul of the dead). It might also be the domain in which it rules or resides. It can also be in the presence of a person it knows well or an item that is significant to it. Stronger ties, yield stronger results. This ritual takes (1d12 + the target’s CR) × 10 minutes to complete. It is unusual to need an offering worth much more than the target’s CR × 100 gp.
</p>
<p>If the spirit is within 30 feet, the price is instead 10 gp + it’s CR; in which case, you can expect it to appear in person, but be careful.
</p>
<p>The barter. You must then convince the spirit to accept an offer in exchange for its knowledge and power. Make a Persuasion check against a DC of 12 + the spirit’s CR. If this check fails you cannot try again until the next day. If a spirit does not share your alignment on either axis or has a more specific reason to be against your cause, it is considered averse to you. You have disadvantage when trying to convince an averse spirit to join you. An averse spirit that has a challenge rating of twice your level or more will not help you. You can only summon a spirit in this way once every long rest. Any spirit will be hesitant to follow a Medium that already has 3 in his company.
</p>
<p>Any creature covered by your repertoire can be channeled, but to do so you must spend time communing with it. Attacking such a creature will generally cause it to refuse.
</p>

<h3>Spirit Quick-Build</h3>
<p>To quickly create a spirit, you need a list of 3-6 skills, some weapon proficiencies and choose 1-3 of its ability scores that it excels in or is higher than its other scores. There are sample sets of these below. If the being channeled is a spirit of nature or has levels in a spellcasting class, it should provide between 2-9 spells. You can simply borrow the spells of a cleric domain or a warlock patron, make your own list, or use one of the sample spell lists below. To make a spirit less useful, leave out spells over a certain level. Sample sets for skills and abilities are listed after.
