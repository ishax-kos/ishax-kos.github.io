                A creature with the "Incorporeal Movement" Ability cannot use this ability to better move through your square. your unarmed strikes count as magical against creatures that are listed as being resistant to "Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing From Nonmagical Attacks" (ghosts and some elementals for example). You can grapple creatures that are immune to the grappled condition.

                Choose a type of creatures from the <b>Type or Subtype</b> column of the "Expanded Repertoire" table. This choice is permanent, but you may take this rite multiple times and choose a new type each time. You gain an additional language depending on your choice according to the table "language" column of the table below. When you use your channeling class feature, you may conjure a willing spirit from another plane directly into your body at no physical risk to itself. Such a creature remains where it was in a meditative state as if concentrating on a spell.

            <h3>Two as One</h3>
            <p>
                You dedicate yourself to a single spirit. When channeling this spirit, you gain your full proficiency bonuses when using the spirit's skills as well as twice your proficiency bonus in skills and with weapons you both have proficiency with. With all other spirits you must take on a taboo, or the normal benifits of channeling are not gained. Time spent channeling your primary spirit does not count towards your maximum time, but running out of time while channeling another spirit will prevent you from channeling your primary spirit.
            </p>
        </li>


        <li>
            <h3>Manifestation</h3>
            <p>
                When you take on a taboo for a channelled spirit, your body physically changes, taking on prominent features of its appearance (you need not take on its appearance in full). In addition, you can obscure yourself within an illusory visage in the image of your spirit. This illusion is intangible but can reproduce sounds and smells as well. Finally, you gain your spirit's special senses such as darkvision or tremorsense out to a range of 60 feet. You also gain any abilities that give you advantage on wisdom (perception) checks in certain scenarios (ie. keen scent).
            </p>

            </p>
        </li>


        <li>
            <h3>Symbiotic scout</h3>

                <p><strong>Attack:</strong> The given natural weapons instead deal 2d6 damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Defence:</strong> The given natural armor give you and armor class of 15 + your Dexterity modifier.</p>
                <p><strong>Movement:</strong> If the spirit had a fly or swim speed, you gain a coresponding 60ft fly or swim speed. Your land speed also increases by 10 feet. </p>
                <p><strong>Sense:</strong> If the spirit had a special sense such as darkvision or tremorsense, you gain that sense with a range of 60 feet. You can speak and directly understand your spirit's languages.

               You can harden your hands and use them as natural weapons a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier. They deal 2d6 damage and have the finesse property. If you have natural weapons already, your hands instead deal 2d8 damage. You regain all expended uses after a long rest.
