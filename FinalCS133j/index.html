                    <p> You must slay Gurnok, for he plans to take the kingdom with his goblin horde! <br>
                        Use the "A" and "D" keys to move left and right, and hold "S" to hit short foes. <br>
                        Be carefull! Your shield only protects you where you aren't attacking! And you're always vulnerable from behind. <br>
                        You can attack by pressing the "Right-shift" key and jump by holding "Enter". <br>
                        You begin falling sooner when you let go of "Enter"
